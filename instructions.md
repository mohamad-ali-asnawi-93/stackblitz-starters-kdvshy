# Instructions  

  Now you can use arguments with `integers`, is it possible with `variables`?

  ## Steps
  1. Create function `fiftiply` where it returns an integer that is mulitplied by `5`. This is similar to what we have done the previous exercise.

  ```javascript
  function fiftiply(num) {
    return num * 5;
  }
  ```

  2. Create variable `first_number` and assign to integer `2`

  ```javascript
  const first_number = 2;
  ```

  3. Create variable `fiftiplied` and assign to function `fiftiply` with argument `first_number`

  ```javascript
  const fiftiplied = fiftiply(first_number)
  ```

  4. Print `fiftiplied` and run the code

  ```javascript
  console.log(fiftiplied);
  ```

  5. Run the test and submit.

Output:

```
10
```
